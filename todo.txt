- change everything to cryptoUnits
- no full bitcoins in brain
- truncate to reasonable precision on final price

all units must be in terms of rates
either base integer unit (wei, satoshi) or regular unit (btc, eth) -- integer units

- how to do precision?
  - need to know display unit
  - truncate to max (3 past dot or 3 digits after 0 if less than 1)

- delay in loading price
- cashOut
- add in selection screen
- better handling of big price swings as far as precision
