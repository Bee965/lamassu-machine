- reject double spend on server (go by sessionId in tx, not header in l-s)

- update unpair (lamassu-scripts), so we can continue testing
- go through other scripts for fingerprint

- two issues:
  - 1. l-m thinks connection is down, no errors
  - 2. l-s with config error, might be fixed in latest code
  - 3. socket hang up error in l-m
