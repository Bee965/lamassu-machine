- consider adding timer, with tap for more time (low priority)

{
  dispense: {},
  pendingTx: tx
}

For use with jsonquest:

v On sendCoins, register tx in db
v Remove from db on: idle
- On startup, if there's a pending tx, handle that first before going to idle state
- reject double spend on server (go by sessionId in tx, not header in l-s)
