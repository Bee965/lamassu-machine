- no full bitcoins in brain
- truncate to reasonable precision on final price

all units must be in terms of rates
either base integer unit (wei, satoshi) or regular unit (btc, eth) -- integer units

- how to do precision?
  - need to know display unit
  - truncate to max (3 past dot or 3 digits after 0 if less than 1)

- better handling of big price swings as far as precision

- l-s: price, wallet, trading [stage 2]
- don't do raqia at this point

- investigate weird adding/rounding (probably because of higher precision exchange rate)
